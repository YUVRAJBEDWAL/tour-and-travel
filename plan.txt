### Comprehensive Plan for Implementing "Split Payment" Feature

#### Information Gathered:
- The `newpage.html` file has a structured layout for payment processing, including sections for booking details and payment steps.
- There is a section for split payment details that can be expanded to accommodate multiple members.

   - Make necessary CSS adjustments to maintain a clean layout.

#### Follow-up Steps:
